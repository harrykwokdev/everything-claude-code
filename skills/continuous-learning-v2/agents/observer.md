# Observer Agent

A background agent that analyzes observations from Claude Code sessions to detect patterns and create instincts.

## When to Run

- After enough observations accumulate (configurable, default 20)
- On a scheduled interval (configurable, default 5 minutes)
- When triggered on demand via SIGUSR1 to the observer process

## Input

Reads observations from the **project-scoped** observations file:
- Project: `~/.claude/homunculus/projects/<project-hash>/observations.jsonl`
- Global fallback: `~/.claude/homunculus/observations.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"timestamp":"2025-01-22T10:30:00Z","event":"tool_start","session":"abc123","tool":"Edit","input":"...","project_id":"a1b2c3d4e5f6","project_name":"my-react-app"}
{"timestamp":"2025-01-22T10:30:01Z","event":"tool_complete","session":"abc123","tool":"Edit","output":"...","project_id":"a1b2c3d4e5f6","project_name":"my-react-app"}
{"timestamp":"2025-01-22T10:30:05Z","event":"tool_start","session":"abc123","tool":"Bash","input":"npm test","project_id":"a1b2c3d4e5f6","project_name":"my-react-app"}
{"timestamp":"2025-01-22T10:30:10Z","event":"tool_complete","session":"abc123","tool":"Bash","output":"All tests pass","project_id":"a1b2c3d4e5f6","project_name":"my-react-app"}
```

## Pattern Detection

Look for these patterns in observations:

### 1. User Corrections
When a user's follow-up message corrects Claude's previous action:
- "No, use X instead of Y"
- "Actually, I meant..."
- Immediate undo/redo patterns

→ Create instinct: "When doing X, prefer Y"

### 2. Error Resolutions
When an error is followed by a fix:
- Tool output contains error
- Next few tool calls fix it
- Same error type resolved similarly multiple times

→ Create instinct: "When encountering error X, try Y"

### 3. Repeated Workflows
When the same sequence of tools is used multiple times:
- Same tool sequence with similar inputs
- File patterns that change together
- Time-clustered operations

→ Create workflow instinct: "When doing X, follow steps Y, Z, W"

### 4. Tool Preferences
When certain tools are consistently preferred:
- Always uses Grep before Edit
- Prefers Read over Bash cat
- Uses specific Bash commands for certain tasks

→ Create instinct: "When needing X, use tool Y"

## Output

Creates/updates instincts in the **project-scoped** instincts directory:
- Project: `~/.claude/homunculus/projects/<project-hash>/instincts/personal/`
- Global: `~/.claude/homunculus/instincts/personal/` (for universal patterns)

### Project-Scoped Instinct (default)

```yaml
---
id: use-react-hooks-pattern
trigger: "when creating React components"
confidence: 0.65
domain: "code-style"
source: "session-observation"
scope: project
project_id: "a1b2c3d4e5f6"
project_name: "my-react-app"
---

# Use React Hooks Pattern

## Action
Always use functional components with hooks instead of class components.

## Evidence
- Observed 8 times in session abc123
- Pattern: All new components use useState/useEffect
- Last observed: 2025-01-22
```

### Global Instinct (universal patterns)

```yaml
---
id: always-validate-user-input
trigger: "when handling user input"
confidence: 0.75
domain: "security"
source: "session-observation"
scope: global
---

# Always Validate User Input

## Action
Validate and sanitize all user input before processing.

## Evidence
- Observed across 3 different projects
- Pattern: User consistently adds input validation
- Last observed: 2025-01-22
```

## Scope Decision Guide

When creating instincts, determine scope based on these heuristics:

| Pattern Type | Scope | Examples |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Language/framework conventions | **project** | "Use React hooks", "Follow Django REST patterns" |
| File structure preferences | **project** | "Tests in __tests__/", "Components in src/components/" |
| Code style | **project** | "Use functional style", "Prefer dataclasses" |
| Error handling strategies | **project** (usually) | "Use Result type for errors" |
| Security practices | **global** | "Validate user input", "Sanitize SQL" |
| General best practices | **global** | "Write tests first", "Always handle errors" |
| Tool workflow preferences | **global** | "Grep before Edit", "Read before Write" |
| Git practices | **global** | "Conventional commits", "Small focused commits" |

**When in doubt, default to `scope: project`** — it's safer to be project-specific and promote later than to contaminate the global space.

## Confidence Calculation

Initial confidence based on observation frequency:
- 1-2 observations: 0.3 (tentative)
- 3-5 observations: 0.5 (moderate)
- 6-10 observations: 0.7 (strong)
- 11+ observations: 0.85 (very strong)

Confidence adjusts over time:
- +0.05 for each confirming observation
- -0.1 for each contradicting observation
- -0.02 per week without observation (decay)

## Instinct Promotion (Project → Global)

An instinct should be promoted from project-scoped to global when:
1. The **same pattern** (by id or similar trigger) exists in **2+ different projects**
2. Each instance has confidence **>= 0.8**
3. The domain is in the global-friendly list (security, general-best-practices, workflow)

Promotion is handled by the `instinct-cli.py promote` command or the `/evolve` analysis.

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be Conservative**: Only create instincts for clear patterns (3+ observations)
2. **Be Specific**: Narrow triggers are better than broad ones
3. **Track Evidence**: Always include what observations led to the instinct
4. **Respect Privacy**: Never include actual code snippets, only patterns
5. **Merge Similar**: If a new instinct is similar to existing, update rather than duplicate
6. **Default to Project Scope**: Unless the pattern is clearly universal, make it project-scoped
7. **Include Project Context**: Always set `project_id` and `project_name` for project-scoped instincts

## Example Analysis Session

Given observations:
```jsonl
{"event":"tool_start","tool":"Grep","input":"pattern: useState","project_id":"a1b2c3","project_name":"my-app"}
{"event":"tool_complete","tool":"Grep","output":"Found in 3 files","project_id":"a1b2c3","project_name":"my-app"}
{"event":"tool_start","tool":"Read","input":"src/hooks/useAuth.ts","project_id":"a1b2c3","project_name":"my-app"}
{"event":"tool_complete","tool":"Read","output":"[file content]","project_id":"a1b2c3","project_name":"my-app"}
{"event":"tool_start","tool":"Edit","input":"src/hooks/useAuth.ts...","project_id":"a1b2c3","project_name":"my-app"}
```

Analysis:
- Detected workflow: Grep → Read → Edit
- Frequency: Seen 5 times this session
- **Scope decision**: This is a general workflow pattern (not project-specific) → **global**
- Create instinct:
  - trigger: "when modifying code"
  - action: "Search with Grep, confirm with Read, then Edit"
  - confidence: 0.6
  - domain: "workflow"
  - scope: "global"

## Integration with Skill Creator

When instincts are imported from Skill Creator (repo analysis), they have:
- `source: "repo-analysis"`
- `source_repo: "https://github.com/..."`
- `scope: "project"` (since they come from a specific repo)

These should be treated as team/project conventions with higher initial confidence (0.7+).
