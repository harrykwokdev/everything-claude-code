# Continuous Learning v2.1 - Instinct
-Based Architecture

An advanced learning system that turns your Claude Code sessions into reusable knowledge through atomic "instincts" - small learned behaviors with confidence scoring.

**v2.1** adds **project-scoped instincts** — React patterns stay in your React project, Python conventions stay in your Python project, and universal patterns (like "always validate input") are shared globally.

## When to Activate

- Setting up automatic learning from Claude Code sessions
- Configuring instinct-based behavior extraction via hooks
- Tuning confidence thresholds for learned behaviors
- Reviewing, exporting, or importing instinct libraries
- Evolving instincts into full skills, commands, or agents
- Managing project-scoped vs global instincts
- Promoting instincts from project to global scope

## What's New in v2.1

| Feature | v2.0 | v2.1 |
|---------|------|------|
| Storage | Global (~/.claude/homunculus/) | Project-scoped (projects/<hash>/) |
| Scope | All instincts apply everywhere | Project-scoped + global |
| Detection | None | git remote URL / repo path |
| Promotion | N/A | Project → global when seen in 2+ projects |
| Commands | 4 (status/evolve/export/import) | 6 (+promote/projects) |
| Cross-project | Contamination risk | Isolated by default |

## What's New in v2 (vs v1)

| Feature | v1 | v2 |
|---------|----|----|
| Observation | Stop hook (session end) | PreToolUse/PostToolUse (100% reliable) |
| Analysis | Main context | Background agent (Haiku) |
| Granularity | Full skills | Atomic "instincts" |
| Confidence | None | 0.3-0.9 weighted |
| Evolution | Direct to skill | Instincts -> cluster -> skill/command/agent |
| Sharing | None | Export/import instincts |

## The Instinct Model

An instinct is a small learned behavior:

```yaml
---
id: prefer-functional-style
trigger: "when writing new functions"
confidence: 0.7
domain: "code-style"
source: "session-observation"
scope: project
project_id: "a1b2c3d4e5f6"
project_name: "my-react-app"
---

# Prefer Functional Style

## Action
Use functional patterns over classes when appropriate.

## Evidence
- Observed 5 instances of functional pattern preference
- User corrected class-based approach to functional on 2025-01-15
```

**Properties:**
- **Atomic** -- one trigger, one action
- **Confidence-weighted** -- 0.3 = tentative, 0.9 = near certain
- **Domain-tagged** -- code-style, testing, git, debugging, workflow, etc.
- **Evidence-backed** -- tracks what observations created it
- **Scope-aware** -- `project` (default) or `global`

## How It Works

```
Session Activity (in a git repo)
      |
      | Hooks capture prompts + tool use (100% reliable)
      | + detect project context (git remote / repo path)

|  projects/<project-hash>/observations.jsonl  |
|   (prompts, tool calls, outcomes, project)   |
+---------------------------------------------+
      |
      | Observer agent reads (background, Haiku)
      v
+---------------------------------------------+

```

## Project Detection

The system automatically detects your current project:

1. **`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` env var** (highest priority)
2. **`git remote get-url origin`** -- hashed to create a portable project ID (same repo on different machines gets the same ID)
3. **`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`** -- fallback using repo path (machine-specific)
4. **Global fallback** -- if no project is detected, instincts go to global scope

Each project gets a 12-character hash ID (e.g., `a1b2c3d4e5f6`). A registry file at `~/.claude/homunculus/projects.json` maps IDs to human-readable names.

## Quick Start

### 1. Enable Observation Hooks

Add to your `~/.claude/settings.json`.

**If installed as a plugin** (recommended):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/continuous-learning-v2/hooks/observe.sh"
      }]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/continuous-learning-v2/hooks/observe.sh"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**If installed manually** to `~/.claude/skills`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "~/.claude/skills/continuous-learning-v2/hooks/observe.sh"
      }]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "~/.claude/skills/continuous-learning-v2/hooks/observe.sh"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### 2. Initialize Directory Structure

The system creates directories automatically on first use, but you can also create them manually:

```bash
# Global directories
mkdir -p ~/.claude/homunculus/{instincts/{personal,inherited},evolved/{agents,skills,commands},projects}

# Project directories are auto-created when the hook first runs in a git repo
```

### 3. Use the Instinct Commands

```bash
/instinct-status     # Show learned instincts (project + global)
/evolve              # Cluster related instincts into skills/commands
/instinct-export     # Export instincts to file
/instinct-import     # Import instincts from others
/promote             # Promote project instincts to global scope
/projects            # List all known projects and their instinct counts
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/instinct-status` | Show all instincts (project-scoped + global) with confidence |
| `/evolve` | Cluster related instincts into skills/commands, suggest promotions |
| `/instinct-export` | Export instincts (filterable by scope/domain) |
| `/instinct-import <file>` | Import instincts with scope control |
| `/promote [id]` | Promote project instincts to global scope |
| `/projects` | List all known projects and their instinct counts |

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` to control the background observer:

```json
{
  "version": "2.1",
  "observer": {
    "enabled": false,
    "run_interval_minutes": 5,
    "min_observations_to_analyze": 20
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `observer.enabled` | `false` | Enable the background observer agent |
| `observer.run_interval_minutes` | `5` | How often the observer analyzes observations |
| `observer.min_observations_to_analyze` | `20` | Minimum observations before analysis runs |

Other behavior (observation capture, instinct thresholds, project scoping, promotion criteria) is configured via code defaults in `instinct-cli.py` and `observe.sh`.

## File Structure

~/.claude/homunculus/
+-- identity.json           # Your profile, technical level
+-- projects.json           # Registry: project hash -> name/path/remote
+-- observations.jsonl      # Global observations (fallback)

```

## Scope Decision Guide

| Pattern Type | Scope | Examples |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Language/framework conventions | **project** | "Use React hooks", "Follow Django REST patterns" |
| File structure preferences | **project** | "Tests in __tests__/", "Components in src/components/" |
| Code style | **project** | "Use functional style", "Prefer dataclasses" |
| Error handling strategies | **project** | "Use Result type for errors" |
| Security practices | **global** | "Validate user input", "Sanitize SQL" |
| General best practices | **global** | "Write tests first", "Always handle errors" |
| Tool workflow preferences | **global** | "Grep before Edit", "Read before Write" |
| Git practices | **global** | "Conventional commits", "Small focused commits" |

## Instinct Promotion (Project -> Global)

When the same instinct appears in multiple projects with high confidence, it's a candidate for promotion to global scope.

**Auto-promotion criteria:**
- Same instinct ID in 2+ projects
- Average confidence >= 0.8

**How to promote:**

```bash
# Promote a specific instinct
python3 instinct-cli.py promote prefer-explicit-errors

# Auto-promote all qualifying instincts
python3 instinct-cli.py promote

# Preview without changes
python3 instinct-cli.py promote --dry-run
```

The `/evolve` command also suggests promotion candidates.

## Confidence Scoring

Confidence evolves over time:

| Score | Meaning | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 0.3 | Tentative | Suggested but not enforced |
| 0.5 | Moderate | Applied when relevant |
| 0.7 | Strong | Auto-approved for application |
| 0.9 | Near-certain | Core behavior |

**Confidence increases** when:
- Pattern is repeatedly observed
- User doesn't correct the suggested behavior
- Similar instincts from other sources agree

**Confidence decreases** when:
- User explicitly corrects the behavior
- Pattern isn't observed for extended periods
- Contradicting evidence appears

## Why Hooks vs Skills for Observation?

> "v1 relied on skills to observe. Skills are probabilistic -- they fire ~50-80% of the time based on Claude's judgment."

Hooks fire **100% of the time**, deterministically. This means:
- Every tool call is observed
- No patterns are missed
- Learning is comprehensive

## Backward Compatibility

v2.1 is fully compatible with v2.0 and v1:
- Existing global instincts in `~/.claude/homunculus/instincts/` still work as global instincts
- Existing `~/.claude/skills/learned/` skills from v1 still work
- Stop hook still runs (but now also feeds into v2)
- Gradual migration: run both in parallel

## Privacy

- Observations stay **local** on your machine
- Project-scoped instincts are isolated per project
- Only **instincts** (patterns) can be exported — not raw observations
- No actual code or conversation content is shared
- You control what gets exported and promoted
